            Combine a love for technology, business and management. 
            This program allows you to complete a Bcomm while heavily focussing on the use of technology in the business world. <break></break>
            My favourite courses are:
        </p2>
        <ol>
            <li>ITM500</li>
            <li>ITM752</li>
            <li>ITM760</li>
        </ol>
        <p3>
            The selected courses in my program are my favourite due to thier involvement in data analytics. Data analysis is the field I plan to get into when I 
            graduate and already have had 3 summer co op oppertunities with RBC in this field. I also plan on getting my masters in Data Analytics when I graduate.
